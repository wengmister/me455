## Q1. Assume the source location is s = [0.3, 0.4], uniformly sample 100 locations in the space, and simulate one measurement for each location. Plot the measurements in the space, if the measurement is positive, plot it as a green dot, otherwise plot it as a red dot. Visualize the “ring-shaped” background seen in Figure 1 as well.
